## 📝 Project Description
**ReadAble** is an accessibility-focused web application engineered to empower learners with dyslexia, dysgraphia, and dyscalculia. The platform utilizes a 10-step diagnostic assessment to identify specific learning barriers—such as letter-flipping and tracking difficulties—and provides a personalized dashboard with customized tasks to reduce visual stress and improve learning outcomes.

## ✨ Features List

### 1. The 10-Step Diagnostic Test
A foundational assessment that analyzes user reading patterns and character recognition to unlock personalized learning paths.

### 2. Visual Lab (Customized Tasks)
* **Letter Trace**: Interactive tool to practice correct stroke paths for commonly flipped letters.
* **Shape Match**: A gamified module matching letters to geometric shadow shapes to improve recognition.
* **Visual Power Quiz**: Challenges users to identify correct letter orientations under varied conditions.

### 3. Sound Lab (Customized Tasks)
* **Story Telling**: Users listen to narrated stories at 0.6x speed with glowing text for audio-visual association.
* **Rhyme Game**: Interactive tasks to find words with similar phonemes (e.g., 'Cat' and 'Hat').
* **Phonics Quiz**: A module where users select the correct character corresponding to a specific sound.

### 4. Focus Lab (Customized Tasks)
* **Digital Reading Ruler**: An on-screen mask that isolates one line of text at a time to prevent "line jumping".
* **Math Dots**: A module for dyscalculia using visual dot patterns to represent numbers for better quantity perception.
* **Letter Hunt**: A scanning exercise to train horizontal eye movement within text blocks.

### 5. Dyslexia-First UI
* **OpenDyslexic Integration**: Specialized fonts with heavy bottoms to prevent mental character rotation.
* **Interactive "Letter Bulge"**: A custom hover effect enlarging individual letters to aid tracking.
